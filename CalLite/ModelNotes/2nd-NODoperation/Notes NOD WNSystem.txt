-Integrated my NOD files with the final system files from the repository 5/3

FolRuleCurv.wresl is currently incomplete.  Need data on Folsom demands to complete lines 25 and 27.  For now set these variables to 100 to get it to run.

In order to get frcst_amr variable used in Americanmin.wresl, added CVPforecasts.wresl to /hydrology/forecast and added tables sacramento_runoff_forecast and american_runoff_forecast (which it uses).

Added file /Wytypes/wytypes.wresl along with table: wytypes.table.  Only included data for the following wyt variables, since those are ones needed in my code so far: wyt_Sac, wyt_Shasta_cvp, wyt_TRIN, wyt_AMER893_cvp 

Added these tables:
! Trinitymin.table
! trinity_import.table
! trinity_level.table
! shasta_level.table
! clear_ck_min.table
! Hst_base.table
! SacValleyIndex.table
! nimbus_hist.table

Put timeseries minflow_C_Kswck into SV DSS 


Removed the following lines from Reservoir-table.wresl, these are now handled in the rule curve code.  For now these are commented out but should be deleted after review.

!define S_Trntylevel3 {select target from res_level where res_num=1,level=4,month=month}
!goal S_TrntyZone3 {S_Trnty_3 < S_Trntylevel3-S_Trntylevel2}
!goal S_TrntyZone4 {S_Trnty_4 < S_Trntylevel4-S_Trntylevel3}
!goal S_TrntyZone5 {S_Trnty_5 < S_Trntylevel5-S_Trntylevel4}
!define S_Shstalevel3 {value S_Shstalevel2}
!goal S_ShstaZone3 {S_Shsta_3 < S_Shstalevel3-S_Shstalevel2}
!goal S_ShstaZone4 {S_Shsta_4 < S_Shstalevel4-S_Shstalevel3}
!goal S_ShstaZone5 {S_Shsta_5 < S_Shstalevel5-S_Shstalevel4}
!goal S_ShstaZone6 {S_Shsta_6 < max(0.,S_Shstalevel6-S_Shstalevel5)}
!define S_Folsmlevel3 {value S_Folsmlevel2}\
!goal S_FolsmZone3 {S_Folsm_3 < S_Folsmlevel3-S_Folsmlevel2}
!goal S_FolsmZone4 {S_Folsm_4 < max(0.,S_Folsmlevel4-S_Folsmlevel3)}
!goal S_FolsmZone5 {S_Folsm_5 < max(0.,S_Folsmlevel5-S_Folsmlevel4)}
!goal S_FolsmZone6 {S_Folsm_6 < S_Folsmlevel6-S_Folsmlevel5}


Also added some weights at this stage, for NOD and Delta stuff, listed below.  

[C_Trnty_EXC,-3], same as C1

[C_Lwstn_EXC,-2010],  ! We no longer have c100_EXC1 and EXC2 as is in Calsim (since we are not conditioning Lewiston spills on spills at Sacramento weirs downstream), so made this weight a little lower than the C_WDelta weight (which was -2000).  Originally EXC1 was -1900 and EXC2 was -2700
[C_Lwstn_MIF, 5500]  same as C100

[C_Wkytn_EXC,-2010],  same as C3
[C_Wkytn_MIF,5500],  same as C3

[C_Kswck_MIF,5500],  same as C5

[C_Nimbus_EXC2,-1266],  same as C9
[C_Nimbus_MIF,5500],   same as C9

[C_HSt_MIF,5500], same as C303
