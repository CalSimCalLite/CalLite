-Integrated Simple Delta and daily Weir code with final NOD and system files from repository 5/17 (Nazrul had also previously added code here for Exports logic and Delta demands).

Added the following table files to lookup directory:
! riovista.table
! eightriver.table
! ndo_flow_std.table
! xchanneldays.table
! x2days.table
! OMRiverFlowEq2.table
! qwest.table
! FRE_weir_No_Notch.table
! SAC_weir.table

Added these three lines to Channel-table.wresl to account for Rio Vista minflows:
define C_SacRV_MIF {std kind 'FLOW-MIN-INSTREAM' units 'CFS'}
define C_SacRV_EXC {std kind 'FLOW-EXCESS-INSTREAM' units 'CFS'}
goal C_SacRVtotal {C_SacRV=C_SacRV_MIF+C_SacRV_EXC}

Got rid of the following goal in the Channel-table.wresl, since this is now set in SoDeltaChannels.wresl
goal zero_C_IndnSl {C_IndnSl = 0.}

In final-mrdo.wresl, left a lot of code commented out since I think it will be needed later.

In SoDeltaChannels.wresl. For final definition of coefficients (from line 70 on), the BO file I was using as a model doesn't use case 5 (it's commented out), so I left this commented out too.

Made the two weights below the same as in Calsim.  

[C_Delta,-2000], same as C407, was -2
[D_DeltaReqd,5000], same as D407, was -10

Added the weight below

[C_SacRV_MIF,5500], same as C405

For use in X2req_km.wresl, added NDO and X2_PRV to INIT DSS.

Added run/external directory with files getFinalMrdo.obj and GetFinalMrdo.f90

Added code to main.wresl to accomodate two cycles needed to run daily weir flows.

Added timeseries day1 to day31 to SV DSS (used for daily weir code).
