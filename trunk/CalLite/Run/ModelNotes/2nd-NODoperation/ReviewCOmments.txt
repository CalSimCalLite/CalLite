Hello All – 

Attached is a revised set of code based on the NODSystem downloaded from the FTP link below.  My comments are as follows:

We need to decide on nomenclature for delivery type, particularly SOD.  Is it xxxP or xxx_P.  One thought is that this shouldn’t be an issue at all, since all SOD deliveries are all “project”, so maybe we could just eliminate the suffix altogether.  But if we have to have it, I prefer xxx_P, since it provides some separation from the name of the node, and follows the same nomenclature as for the NP and P deliveries in the north.  

A couple of comments changed in the system files.

Let’s start putting all the includes in separate files – not the main file – where this seems like a prudent way to cluster logic.  We’re going to have to do it sooner or later – may as well start now.  Added new files system.wresl and nod.wresl.

Removed the assumption/placeholder for cvp allocation for now – we don’t need it yet.  

On review of results, the changes are in keeping with expected changes given the addition of minimum flows and reservoir storage level identification.  Flows are being met, and storage is being managed.  I’ll do some more review later on, but what I’ve seen so far looks okay.  

Erik (and everyone) please let me know if you have any questions on my changes.

Tom and Cody – please go ahead and implement the simple delta logic, weirs, and OMR calculation.  

Thanks,
Nancy
